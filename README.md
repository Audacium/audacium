# Archived - Use Tenacity
Audacium has officially merged with Tenacity! Please use the latter instead of Audacium from now on.

## Reorganisation needed
The code rn is a mess. Before working on anything new, we should be fixing the codebase but it needs lots of effort and very hard for a sleeping project like ours.
It would be cool if someone helps to clean up the codebase. - Ross Maxx
