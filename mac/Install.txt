* To install or reinstall Audacium, drag the "Audacium.app" icon in the
   DMG window to the /Applications folder icon on the right. Alternatively,
   drag the "Audacium.app" icon to any other location of your choosing. 

* Do not double-click the "Audacium" icon in the DMG to launch Audacium 
   from there. 
   
* If you still have an "Audacium" installation folder for a version before 
   2.1.3, you will see working duplicates of Audacium's shipped Nyquist
   plug-ins in the Generate, Effect or Analyze Menu. You may also see 
   non-working duplicates of other previously shipped plug-ins. To clean
   up the duplicates please see:
