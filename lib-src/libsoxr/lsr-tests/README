The C source and header files in this directory have been copied from
the `libsamplerate' project and are copyrighted by its authors -- see
the notices within the files and the file `COPYING' for details.

They are used here to test libsoxr's optional libsamplerate-like
wrapper.  The only modifications made are to the file `snr_bw_test.c' to
remove reliance on certain frequency response troughs that are specific
to libsamplerate.
