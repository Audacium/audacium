## Goals of this project
The goals **Audacium** is trying to achieve are pretty simple :
- Restoring Audacity to what it was before, with no crash reporting (GH Issues exist for that), or very simple update checking (only at startup, not periodically)
- Adding new features people want, listening closely to the community
- Make the code base easier to work with, less confusing for a newbie
